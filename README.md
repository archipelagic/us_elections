# Analysis of US Presidential Elections 2020

By scraping data from the NYT's election API, we are able to look at some of the patterns for the votes of the the different candidates.

Most of the analysis provided here uses time series to check how the share of votes developed in different states, but many other things are possible.

The `csv` folder contains some of the files generated from this API, especially the `nyt_ts.csv`, should the API ever stop working.
