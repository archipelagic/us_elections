# Analysis of US Presidential Elections 2020

During the 2020 US Presidential Elections, followers of the then-incumbent, Donald Trump, repeatedly made the claim that the election was "stolen". The evidence they cited in favor of this theory ranged from hearsay and repitloid-style conspiracies to more sophisticated data analyses, e.g. with reference to [Benford's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law). Because the "proofs" multiplied quickly and refuting them is time-consuming, I decided to pick apart one particularly popular one and document its shortcomings here: The idea that fake ballots were secretly added to tip the scale in favor of the Democrats.

A summary of my findings, and a more prosaic explanation of the meaning of certain graphs created in this repo, can be [found here](https://issing-daniel.medium.com/fraud-patterns-in-absentee-ballots-what-the-data-really-says-599411a1bf70).


## Method

I was scraping data for the vote shares of both major parties using an [API provided by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/%7b%7d/president.json), which is the same that was used by the creators of the voting fraud theory. It has since gone offline, so I've also uploaded the csv files generated by the scraper.
